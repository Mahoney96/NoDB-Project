# VENTO aka. 'Vent Openly' - A space to index/log any self-frustrations/worries that are stuck on a repeative for-Loop running in your head, and a save space to track a few goals if you’re feeling like it. - Stop overthinking, write down your problems visually, accept how minimal they are, make a plan to overcome. 


## Application Concapt and Wireframe

### Application Concept

- This is a self-wellness scheduling and loggin app. 
- Full CRUD
- GET: get
- POST:
- PUT:
- Delete: 

### Functionality 

- Want the header at the top to display the name of the app. 
- when App loads, three clickable boxes will appear as the App's main  directory menu: "Profile", "VENTO Log", "Profile Settiings".
    - Profile: Cickable button, loads the Profile Menu page. 
    - VENTO Log: Cickable button, loads the VENTO Log Menu screen. 
    - Profile Settings: Cickable button, loads the Profile Settings Menu. 
-



- Profile Menu Page

- Displays a User profile button and a 'user settings' button. 

    -User Profile: Click on the button and the user info with appear in a dropdown Action-taken: returning info from the back-end for that user, then the user has option to edit current info.

    -User settings:
        - User settings contains a boolean returning a 'true or 'false' property regarding if users are sharing their profile info with other users. So the boolean is either permission granted or denied. 





























This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
